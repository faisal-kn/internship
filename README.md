# Intern-test

In this assignment I have used Sql database and jwt auth.

It contains 3 pages: 
1. signup page
2. login page
3. detail page

### signup page
when all the fields are entered and each of the specification mentioned is fullfilled it will create the user account and log him in.
i have used jwt autentication with cookie.

### login page

if given name and password are correct then it will log in the website and a auth cookie will be created.

### detail page
It has all the users in the database in the present and all of their details and a logout button to log out of the application.

The website is deployed on heroku.
